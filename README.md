# CutNPeel

## Overview
**CutNPeel** is a fast search algorithm for a high-quality set of near bi-cliques.\
**CutNPeel** has the following advantages :
  * **High Quality** : CutNPeel provides near bi-cliques o up to 51.2% better quality than the second best one.
  * **Speed** : CutNPeel is up to 68.8Ã— faster than the competitors that is second best in terms of quality.
  * **Scalability** : empirically, CutNPeel scales near linearly with the size of the input graph.
  * **Applicability** : CutNPeel is successfully applicable to lossless graph compression and interesting pattern discovery.
